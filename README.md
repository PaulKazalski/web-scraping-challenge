# web-scraping-challenge

This file is incomplete.  I was so far able to create the html page, use Pandas to scrape the necessary data and 
import that data into a MongoDB.

I have yet to compile the scraped data into a single function.  I also have not pushed the MongoDB file into the html file.

These additions will be forthcoming.
